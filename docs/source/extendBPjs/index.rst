Extending BPjs
===============

Out of its proverbial box, BPjs enables "classic" behavioral programming: running multiple b-threads who coordinate through events. It's a start, and quite often it's enough. But sometimes one needs BPjs to behave a bit differently. This section of the manual discusses how to alter BPjs' default behavior to suite your specific needs.
