BPjs Execution Runtime
----------------------

This program takes a series of BPjs files, and executes or verifies them 
as a single BProgram.

Use "-" to also read from stdin.

BProgram log and event sequence are written to stdout.

Switches:
   -v ("verbose")
        Print more data about the BProgram's status as synchronization points.
   --verify 
        Verify the program, rather than execute it. Uses a default inspection set.
   --liveness
        Verify the b-program for liveness properties only. Only considered when --verify is present.
   --max-trace-length=<value>
        Sets the maximum trace length to <value>.
   --full-state-storage (verification only)
        Use full state storage, rather than a hashed one.
